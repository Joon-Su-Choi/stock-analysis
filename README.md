#### 1. Overview of Project


Purpose & Background

	Steve wants to research the stock market for his parents so to accomplish this we wrote out a code in VBA to display and analyze the dataset of the entire stock market over the last few years. Due to the fact that there are thousands of stocks this might take quite some time. To save some of this time we have refactored the code so that it becomes more efficient and executes faster.


#### 2. Results


Overview of Analysis

	According to the data, we observe that 2017 has seen more growth than 2018 for almost all stocks and majority of those stocks had a negative return in 2018 as well. If we were to invest in a stock we see that ENPH has seen a 129.5% increase in 2017 and a 81.9% increase in 2018. RUN has seen a small increase of 5.5% in 2017 but in 2018 they saw a 84% increase. These would be the two stocks to invest in judging from the data.

	  As we can see from our execution on the old and refactored scripts, the refractored scripts ran much faster. We were able to save time and consolidate the script efficiently.


#### 3. Summary

Advantages & Disadvantages of Reactoring Code in General

	There are many advantages to refactoring code such as it can help you comb over the script and find bugs. It is also more efficient as it imrproves the design of the software, which makes it easier to read. Refactoring also helps programming faster.

	There are also foreseeable disadvantages of refactoring code. Refactoring can be time consuming. It is hard to judge how much time you will actually spend on refactoring the code and the chances of mistakes could happen which would halt the process even further. This loss of time is a loss in money for companies.

Advantages & Disadvantages of the Orignal and Refactored VBA Script

	The advantage of the original script was that we wrote out the code accurately and specifically line by line. So there were less likely to be mistakes and to push the program through was slightly easier. The disadvantage of the script was the amount of time spent writing each of those lines out. The act of writing each specific individual line out and also checking along the way for each line took quite some time.

	The advantage of refactoring this script was that it allowed us to clean up the code and make it more concise and easier to read. The program was also allowed to execute faster because of this. The disadvantage of refactoring this script was that it did take up quite some time because of mistakes we had to check for and the experimenting to see what lines of code would work and how to debug them.
